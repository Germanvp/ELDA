# Extensive Language for Data Analysis (ELDA)

### Vision / Purpose
Extensive Language for Data Analysis is born with the vision of providing a tool for data analysis that results from a commitment in equal parts between the learning of a programming language focused on data analysis, and the efficient handling of data for processing in useful calculations for anyone with context in data science. All this with the purpose that the language serves as a facilitator for users without technological context in the adoption of analysis tools, thus being a bridge between people with mathematical knowledge but without programming knowledge to the use of more robust data analysis and manipulation tools.

As a result of this, two main conclusions can be drawn. First, it is not expected that language users have prior knowledge about programming of any kind, since it is expected that this knowledge can be obtained through the use of it. And second, once the basic knowledge about the programming oriented to the data analysis is achieved, calculations can be made with enough depth for the language to be considered useful in the prototyping of more robust solutions.

### Main objective
The objective of E.L.D.A is to be a facilitator for people with no programming experience who wish to do basic statistical calculations such as: mean, variance, standard deviation, clustering, data classification, graph plotting, etc. It aims to shorten the gap between people with and without experience in technology such as graduates and students.
Â 
ELDA belongs to the same category of languages as R, MATLAB and Octave, which allow matrix manipulation and data mapping. The difference between these languages that are more established and our project is that ELDA does not intend to do everything that these languages do; Analysis of time series, for example, are things that are beyond the scope of this compiler. The main purpose of our compiler is to be the first step in the transition to use these languages.
